# Grain-Palette
A Deep Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification Through Transfer Learning
GrainPalette is a deep learning-based project for classifying rice grain types using transfer learning. It leverages pretrained CNN architectures (like ResNet, EfficientNet) to achieve high accuracy on rice grain image datasets.

ðŸš€ Features:
Uses Transfer Learning to fine-tune pretrained models.
Supports image classification of multiple rice varieties.
Modular structure for data loading, training, evaluation.
Jupyter notebook for EDA and experimentation
